## Prebuilds

Gitpod [prebuild](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/prebuilds) reduces wait time, by installing dependencies and running builds **before** you start a new workspace.

Unfortunately, these prebuilds work as a cache. You could encounter a prebuild with outdated packages.

If that is the case, you can [trigger a new prebuild](https://gitpod.io/#prebuild/https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail-gitpod).
